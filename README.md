# Offline refactoring challenges

## Scenario 1 
### Refactor / fix issues

* Review the HTML (aspx) and VB.NET program in the [refactor/scenario1](refactor/scenario1) folder. 
* It is a very simple scenario that saves registration with patient and guarantor.
* However, this program has several problems and does not work. 
* Refactor / fix this code to incorporate programming best practices. If you are not comfortable coding in VB.NET, please use C#.
* Please fork and submit link to your repo for review. 
* Please use branches and check-in often in your forked repo so we can also review how you refactor iteratively and use source control effectively.
